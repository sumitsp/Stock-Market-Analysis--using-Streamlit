Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python. ... Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear
trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

Prophet follows the sklearn model API. We create an instance of the Prophet class and then call its fit and predict methods.

The input to Prophet is always a dataframe with two columns: ds and y. The ds (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by Pandas, 
ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp. The y column must be numeric, and represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

1) # Python
2) import pandas as pd
3) from prophet import Prophet
